# Smart-Light-Sensing-Circuit-Switch-For-AC
Smart-Light-Sensing-Circuit-Switch-For-AC In this project, I created a smart light sensing switch for my home's backyard. It works like charm. In daytime you don't have to off and, on the bulb switch manually, it's automatic and based on day/night situation.
